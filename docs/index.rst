PBI Tools
=========

**PBI Tools** is an object-orientated Python library that makes working with Power BI files easier.

It was designed to support Power BI development and deployment (CICD) using Azure Service Principals.
Specifically, it looks to solve two common problems:

1. Storing PBIX files in repos without also storing the data
2. Publishing reports that point to a separate Power BI model that no longer exists (e.g. the model used during development has since been superceded).

.. warning::
   This library is currently in alpha - feel free to use it experimentally.
   If you do come across any issues, feel free to raise them on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/thomas-daughters/pbi-tools/issues>`_.

Installation
------------

.. code-block::

   $ pip install pbi-tools

Getting Started
---------------

First, create a workspace object:

.. code-block:: python

   from pbi.api import Workspace, Tenant

   tenant = Tenant(tenant_id, service_principal_id, service_principal_secret)

   workspace = Workspace(tenant, workspace_id)
   print(f'Connected to the {workspace.name} workspace!')

We can do some useful things just using the workspace, for example refresh all datasets:

.. code-block:: python

   workspace.refresh(wait=True)

Rename all reports in just a few lines:

.. code-block:: python

   reports = workspace.get_reports()
   for report in reports:
      new_name = f'{report.name} - Archived'
      report.rename(new_name)

Or get the parameters for a given model:

.. code-block:: python

   import pprint as pp

   dataset = workspace.find_dataset('My Dataset')
   params = dataset.get_parameters()
   pp.pprint(params)

Deployment Guide
----------------

This section walks through a typical deployment setup.

API Reference
-------------

Full documentation for all public classes and methods.

.. toctree::
   api/tenant
   api/workspace
   api/report
   api/dataset
   api/datasource
   api/token

There are a few standalone functions that are used by the class methods, but may also be useful on their own.

   api/tools

Access and Authenitcation
-------------------------

The Service Principal requires access to the PowerBI Dashboard at 3 different places:

 * Admin API Access
 * Non-Admin API Access
 * User Access
